Currently following this to make my form https://medium.com/make-it-heady/react-typescript-hooks-form-validation-with-formik-yup-and-material-ui-d4901efc0096

Then once form is done, I need to design my room UI.

Then once room UI is done, I need to create my backend service.

Then once backend service is done, I want to review if I should use magic link authentication or keep it simple with anon users.
